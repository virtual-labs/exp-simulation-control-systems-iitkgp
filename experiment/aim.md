### Aim of the experiment
To simulate some control systems and study their behaviour.
				 
1. To plot the response of a unity feedback system for different values of damping ratio (&zeta;) and calculate its rise time (t<sub>r</sub>), settling time (t<sub>s</sub>), &prcent; maximum overshoot. 

2. To plot the root locus diagram of a unity feedback system and plot the output response of the system for different values of amplifier gain(k). 

3. To check the stability of a unity feedback system by drawing bode and nyquist diagrams and hence indicate the gain margin, phase margin, gain cross over frequency, phase cross over frequency.  

4. To study the system response of a permanent magnet dc motor.
