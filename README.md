### About the Experiment 
**System description**

**System**
				
A system is an abstract object that accepts inputs and produces outputs in response. Systems will also be referred to as plants or processes. The field of control systems deals with applying or choosing the inputs to a given system to achieve a desired output.
The automatic control or feedback control has become an integral part of modern manufacturing and industrial processes.
When a number of elements or components are connected in a sequence to perform a specific function, the group thus formed is called a system. In a system when output quantity is controlled by varying the input quantity, the system is called control system.
The output quantity is called controlled variable or response and input quantity is called command signal or excitation.<br/>

In this experiment, the behaviour of some control systems will be analysed and simulation of their responses will be observed. With the help of problem statement, the behaviour of a unity feedback system, nyquist plot, bode plot,
root locus and system response of a permanent magnet dc motor will be discussed.
